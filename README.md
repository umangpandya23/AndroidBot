# RobotControl
This project consists of a program called “ROBOT CONTROLLED BY ANDROID”. As a part of an early stage project, it has been the goal of this project to serve as a prototype for such venture having set the paths to a wide range of new opportunities in the field of remote controlled robots interaction. The initial and ongoing idea is to build a virtual environment for managing real robots states and field data and on the other side getting users to build their own robots with the capability of teleoperation. This way, robots may interact in the same location as users control them from any place in the world using internet and wireless networks for this purpose. An important side of the project is to build an actual robot that is subject to wireless operation from a PC or a smartphone. In this context, a requirement of simplicity was set in order to focus on  operability and functionality, as this project is meant to serve as a starting point for the soon-to- come fully operational robots. Along with simplicity comes the benefit of being able to reduce  costs to a minimum, task that has been successfully accomplished. In the end, on one side, an inexpensive robot has been designed and built, and on the other side both the robot’s software and the smartphone’s software have been developed, resulting in an android controlled robot. One can operate this robot even by voice just speaking command and robot will act accordingly.
